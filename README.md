# biosensing-resonator-sim
A straightforward script that calculates and graphs the effect of changing waveguide parameters on the functionality of a hybrid ring resonator for PIC. Used mainly for visualizing the relationship between Ring Sensitivity, FSR, FOM, Group Index, Quality Factor, and the length of the slot waveguide. 

Calculations and equations based on the hybrid waveguide presented in "Hybrid-Waveguide Ring Resonator for Biochemical Sensing" by Steiglich et al, 2017.
