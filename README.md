# biosensing-resonator-sim
A straightforward script that calculates and graphs the effect of changing waveguide parameters on the functionality of a hybrid ring resonator for PIC.

Calculations and equations based on the hybrid waveguide presented in "Hybrid-Waveguide Ring Resonator for Biochemical Sensing" by Steiglich et al, 2017.
